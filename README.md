# fractals
A project for AP CS, where we render 3D fractals using distance estimators and ray marching.

## Week 1 Update (4/11)
<ul>
  <li>GUI/rendering somewhat working</li>
  <li>Some GUI features including: changing the color of a single pixel, creating a colored rectangle on the screen</li>
  <li>Keyboard and mouse controls implemented, but need to be connected to the computing classes</li>
</ul>
