# fractals
A project for AP CS, where we render 3D fractals using distance estimators and ray marching.

##Week 1 Update (4/11)
-GUI/rendering somewhat working
-Some GUI features including: changing the color of a single pixel, creating a colored rectangle on the screen
-Keyboard and mouse controls implemented, but need to be connected to the computing classes
